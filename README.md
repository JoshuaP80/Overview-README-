# Overview-README- 

My name is Joshua Pangburn and I recently graduated the business analytics bootcamp at TripleTen and I am currently looking for work as a BI analyst. 

I have worked on projects in Google Sheets, Tableau and Power BI. I also have some experience in SQL.

I have posted four projects (as of writings this), with two of them being done in Google Sheets and two of them in Tableau.

If you have any questions or would like to talk about job opportunities, please feel free to contact me via email or whatever method you prefer.
